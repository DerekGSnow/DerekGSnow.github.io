---

I'm Derek Snow, an MIS senior with a passion for technology, research, and helping others. 
Although my background is mainly technical, my main interest is in how technology can help others and how I can use my skills to teach or assist others.

### What else
There's some crucial things about me 
- I thrive in the unknown
- I don't like to stop researching until I fully grasp a topic
- I love reading and sharing what I learn with others
- My favorite place to visit is Oregon
- I'm a huge tabletop roleplaying game nerd (D&D, Pathfinder, etc.)

### My story

I'm from Chickasha, Oklahoma, although I went to school in an even smaller town of Ninnekah. I've had a varied history, transferring from Cameron University to OU. While at OU, I started in Computer Science but eventually switched into Management Information Systems so that I could focus on the human side of technology. With a minor in CS, a degree in MIS, a history of communication, research, and leading, I am confident that I can help others in the realm of IT.
