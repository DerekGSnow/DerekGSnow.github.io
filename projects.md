# School Projects

### Databases
I worked in a team to develop a database for a fictional Taco Truck. Using MS SQL Server, we went through the entire database construction process from creating the ERD, to logical design, normalization, and finally physical design and implementation.

### Web Development
You're using a site I've developed! From the Beautiful Jekyll template, I've added a few customizations to make it my own. I've also added a few pages to showcase my work.

# Personal Projects

### Foundry Server Hosting
I hosted a server on a Raspberry PI for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). I used Docker to containerize the server and used a reverse proxy to allow for HTTPS. I also used a dynamic DNS service to allow for a domain name.
